# Impressionistic-Painting-of-an-RGB-Image
This algorithm will convert any RGB image into an impressionistic painting, where the characteristics are determined by the function input
This algorithm uses the image processing toolbox to accomplish its effect

***To use***
First open the newpaint.m file. This will have the characteristics of the painting you want to cover
Here is the characteristic determinators:

% threshold: this will determine how tightly packed the strokes will appear. Higher means tighter
% brushstroke is the size, must be an array 
% blurfactor is a small number less than 1 
% minstrokelen will be the smallest brush length 
% maxstrokelen will be the largest brush length 
% brush curve will limit curvature of the brush 
% spacing multiples with brush size to determine grid size
